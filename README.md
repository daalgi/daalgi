### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a civil structural engineer and self-taught software developer. Here're some side projects I've been working on:
- [unitscenter.com](https://www.unitscenter.com/) is a smart units converter that engineers love.
- [engineering-portfolio-map](https://daalgi.github.io/engineering-portfolio-map/) is an interactive map with the projects that I've participated in.
- [react-sudoku](https://daalgi.github.io/react-sudoku/)
- [algorithms](https://github.com/daalgi/algorithms): collection of 300+ leetcode solved problems in python.
