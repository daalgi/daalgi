### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a civil engineer and self-taught software developer. Here're some side projects I've been working on:
- [unitscenter.com](https://www.unitscenter.com/) is a smart units converter.
- [civilengineer.dev](https://civilengineer.dev/) is my blog, where I write about wind energy, civil engineering, FEM and software development.
- [engineering-portfolio-map](https://daalgi.github.io/engineering-portfolio-map/) is an interactive map with the projects that I've participated on.
